    <h1>Testimonials</h1>
    <p class=customer>The following are testimonials from previous customers. Copies of the originals can be viewed upon request.</p>
	<p>'Over recent years we have had an extension to a utility room/replacing of a flat roof to a pitched roof on the garage, completion of a timber car port with tiled pitch roof and an access drive. From the provision of a quotation to the completion of the works we have been highly impressed by the way Andy has project managed the work...' <span class=customer>Mr & Mrs Willetts, Enmore Green</span><p>
	<p>'We've now used AP Roberts for two different works. Firstly we commissioned AP Roberts to convert our garage into a family room. We were extremely impressed with the quality of work and attention to detail. The job was carried out on time and for a sensible price and all contractors were a pleasure to deal with. Shortly afterwards, requiring the construction of a structural retaining wall at our new home we again asked Andy to quote and, as expected, the standard of work carried out was outstanding. In fact, the end result was far better than we could have imagined. I would have no hesitation in recommending AP Roberts to anyone and it should go without saying that for any future projects Andy would be our first port of call.'<span class=customer>Mr & Mrs Tettmar, Fontmell Magna</span><p>
	<p>'From start to finish we had nothing to worry about except choosing fixtures and fittings etc.,everything ran smoothly and we were kept advised as to what was happening at all times.Any changes that you suggested made a lot of sense and most of those ideas we went along with, we put our trust in you and it paid off.....for piece of mind we would recommend A.P Roberts ltd and would both like to thank Andy for an excellent job' <span class=customer>Mr & Mrs Thorne, Shaftesbury (new build - farmhouse, Cann Hill, Shaftesbury</span><p>

It has been a pleasure to have had you and your team working here'<span class=customer>Mr Wray, Shaftesbury (garage conversion)</span><p>
	<p>'We were impressed from the start how the extension above the garage progressed.....we were also impressed by the various sub-contractors who were polite and considerate at all times.
